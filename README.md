How the K-means algorithm works:


To process the learning data, the K-means algorithm in data mining starts with a first group of randomly selected centroids, which are used as the beginning points for every cluster, and then performs iterative (repetitive) calculations to optimize the positions of the centroids
It halts creating and optimizing clusters when either:
The centroids have stabilized — there is no change in their values because the clustering has been successful.
The defined number of iterations has been achieved.
K-means algorithm example problem
Let’s see the steps on how the K-means machine learning algorithm works using the Python programming language.
We’ll use the Scikit-learn library and some random data to illustrate a K-means clustering simple explanation.
